                            <p class="f_400 ">While using the education loan EMI calculator, you must remember that Avanse works with a floating education loan interest rate in India. We do this to ensure you always get the most competitive rate of interest. We calculate the interest on your loan using the formula: Interest = Avanse Base Rate + Spread.</p>
                            <p>To get an estimate of your monthly EMI, you can use the base rate of 12.65% on the education loan calculator. The spread changes periodically based on your overall credit and course profiling. We use a simple interest rate with monthly rest to calculate the interest rate for education loans.  </p>

The repayment calculator provides you with almost accurate estimates of how a prepayment or change in tenure will impact your remaining EMIs.</p>

                                    <p>There are many factors that determine your eligibility to apply for an education loan. You can use this calculator to input information about your family’s current financial situation to understand your eligibility to take a loan.
